Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization. NumPy: For mathematical operations and handling arrays. Problem: The project aimed to analyze and predict financial trends using datasets provided by Experian. The challenge was to calculate and predict annual gross income from monthly net income while dealing with data limitations, such as negative values and a lack of detailed attributes.

Action Taken:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The datasets were loaded and partitioned into a test dataset and a holdout dataset. Various preprocessing steps were undertaken, including handling missing values and converting dates to datetime objects. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted to identify data inconsistencies, such as negative monthly net revenues. Visualization through line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to understand price trends, volume distribution, and feature correlations.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features like price change, moving averages, and volatility indicators to enhance the analysis.

Machine Learning Models:

Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, and Gradient Boosting. Used cross-validation for model evaluation and tuning. Developed a custom Python function to calculate projected annual gross income from the holdout dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Assessed models using precision score, accuracy score, and confusion matrix. Visualized results using scatter plots and regression lines for better interpretation.

Integration with Gold Data:

Integrated Bitcoin data with gold price data for comparative analysis. Trained models on combined datasets to explore correlations and enhance predictive accuracy.

Solutions:

Custom Python Function:

Developed to accurately calculate annual gross income, addressing discrepancies and improving prediction accuracy.

Enhanced Data Analysis:

Implemented thorough EDA and feature engineering to uncover valuable insights despite data limitations.

Model Optimization:

Utilized cross-validation and tuning to refine machine learning models, achieving a variance of less than 10% in predictions.

Summary:

The Crypto-Analytics project successfully leveraged data analytics and machine learning to predict financial trends and calculate annual gross income from monthly net income. By addressing data inconsistencies and limitations, the team developed robust predictive models and custom functions. The project highlighted the importance of comprehensive data analysis and model optimization in financial analytics, providing significant insights into financial characteristics and improving predictive accuracy for both Bitcoin and combined Bitcoin-Gold datasets.
